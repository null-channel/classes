# Wrap up

Ok. so we learned not only what resources in kubernetes are, but we also learned to manage some of the basic resources out there! While all of this might seem a bit overwhelming I want to encourage you, It gets better and better. I suggest the best way to solidify this is to USE IT! go, run a kubernetes server at home! The more you use it and deal with it the easier and easier it will get!

Did you like this? it's just part one of three! So check out the other parts and learn more and more! Not only that, did you know that these are opensource? they are. you can go and contribute to all of these classes on github! not only are these classes opensource but so are the challanges and a lot more! If these helped you, please feel free to contribute back to this community and help build more and more educational opensource materials!

Ok. so if you liked it and want to move on to the next part you will learn all about kubernetes networking, services and a few more advanced tools that are going to help you expose your application to the world! Thanks again!
