# Local cluster

Ok, so to follow along we are going to do a lot of experimenting and I think its really important to get a local kubernetes cluster you can play around. That being said I will be providing labs for a lot of it, some of them will be online in your web browser and not require any of this, but there will be some that have extention objectives that can be done on your local clusters as they provide more flexability.

Ok, so i'm going to give you the steps here for local kubernetes clusters on linux but will link ot some awesome tutorials to bing kubernetes to mac and windows. though you could follow these instructions on windows subsystem for linux.
