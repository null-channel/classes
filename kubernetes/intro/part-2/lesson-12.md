Lesson 12: Ingress 

Ok, so services expose, well... services. Right. But most likely if you are looking at kubernets you have a whole fleet of services that all make up your application or infrastructure. This means you are going to probably want to interact with them seamlessly, not wanting to have an IP address for each service. Think of your web app, it might have an accounts service, it might have a live feed service, a service to aggregate logs and a service to provide users with a UI or whatever else your application needs. You might even want to easily and simply get versions of your different api's so that you can easily migrate traffic to newer versions of services while supporting the older versions for a limited amount of time. Thankfully kubernetes gives us a way to do this. otherwise we would have a loadbalancer and service for each of our applications and that would not be that fun. not at all. Most of the time I think it would be really nice
